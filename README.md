# Origami TV Remote
Prototype for TV interfaces with Origami Studio.

## Step 1: Install node.js on your computer.
## Step 2: Install Origami Studio on your computer, if you haven't already.
## Step 3: Download the contents of this repo.  
You'll only really need the Origami Server app, which will spin up a local server and provide you with a URL to access the TV remote on your iPhone.

After that, you can open the demo origami project and check that origami is recieving commands from your phone remote. 

## Then, you're on your own... :)
